                <p>I am currently trying to keep alive my now 5 basil plants. We had a few harsh summer days and I had
                    to say goodbye to one of them last week. RIP</p>

                    <dd>I have gone through the documentation. Now I am experimenting with complementary bits. Netlify,
                        EmotionCss, Gatbsy, JAM. It's all about sending that email from a codepen</dd>
                    <dt>Flexibility & Work</dt>
                    <dd> 3 years of sitting in an office chair takes it's toll. I started stretching out and getting
                        that flexibility back I actually never had in first place. I also started going to the gym
                        hoping to build up some muscle to finally reach the 6C in bouldering</dd>
