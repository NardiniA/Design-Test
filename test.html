    <p>Policies and Guidelines for Managing Organisational IT Security Issues
    
    Disaster Recovery Policies -
    (Data Protection Policy Page 13)
    Disaster recovery policies are used by organisations affected by a disaster with the aim to carry on working.
    There are many disasters which could cause an organisation to use this policy such as:
    Flooding,
    Fires destroying the building,
    Viruses corrupting data,
    Worker strikes,
    Natural disasters such as an earthquake,
    Terrorism,
    Murder for information,
    Power failure,
    and many more.
    
    This is usually a document with details on what to do in such circumstances.
    For example, it could contain emergency numbers, details on temporary work buildings, backups , escape routes, possible
    new or temporary equipment hire, data movement and more.
    It will also include an insurance policy to pay for the extra costs of recovery.
    It's an extremely important policy for all companies to have.
    Because of this policy procedures can be taken when a disaster occurs so the company can carry on working.
    The procedures depend on the type of disaster. Some of the procedures can be - using an alternative website if the main
    one has crashed.
    In case of a strike, additional personnel could be used instead of the workers on strike, so work can be done, and the
    effects of the disaster solved.
    For damages to buildings or systems , there should be levels of insurance used to fund that kind of damage for quick
    recovery.
    This policy is used by organisations as disasters like these could be common problems for the organisation or they might
    have a big impact on the organisations’ systems or buildings. Having this policy would ensure the organisation recovers
    quickly after a disaster, it can carry on working and keep their customers happy.
    
    
    Updating of Security Procedures -
    (Code Of Conduct 2.2.1 and 2.7)
    Updating security is really important both for the system and building.
    
    Organisations need to have procedures to check security and update it if needed.
    New threats will always appear whether it’s a virus or terrorist attack, companies need to be prepared.
    Updates should also be checked before they’re put into place and it is done to make sure that the new update works well
    and that there are no bugs.
    Activity logs can show faults that can be fixed before they become serious.
    Security audits should also be checked on how the security policy is realistically being operated and this should be
    done regularly.
    With audits it is also possible to prevent hackers from getting unauthorised access to the system because it will check
    if the system is secure or not.
    The audits are used to analyse the database and network logs to look for issues that might be occurring which could mean
    a possible threat to the organisation, the audits are also helpful in analysing flaws in the system and checking if the
    system is reliable.
    Some organisations will even hire people to test if they can break into the system or building and if they can break in,
    they will know which areas need more updating or security.
    It is really important to keep security procedures updated to keep up with the new technologies and threats in the
    world. Along with checking if the procedures are valid and working. If any of the updates or checks are not done this
    becomes a problem and a threat to the organisation because access can become easy to obtain.
    
    Codes of Conduct -
    (Code Of Conduct 2.1.10)
    The code of conduct is a policy that the company has put into place in order to protect the company from threats like an
    employee breaking the system by downloading malicious software. Employees that sign it must follow a set of rules
    outlining the responsibilities or proper practices an individual should follow.
    It is not good enough to trust people to use a computer system properly. A code of conduct is needed. Employees working
    in the company should sign the code of conduct, if they have read and signed the agreement they will then have to follow
    the rules and take responsibility.
    If the employees don’t follow the guidelines which have been set by the organisation, then it will lead to a security
    alert which can ban the employee from accessing certain features of the system in the organisation.
    Every organisation should have a code of conduct to be signed by anyone that will be using the system. The code of
    conduct will consist of what you should do while using the system and the consequences for violating it. By an
    individual signing the contract they are legally responsible for anything they do with the system. The code of conduct
    can be used for both an employee and a customer that will use the system to sign in.
    The policies given to the user will depend on what the organisation will decide that is best for their company and the
    security of their organisation. This makes the network and the environment of work a better and safe place because of
    the restricted access. For example, if an employee was allowed to send messages via email to a user who is not within
    the organisation, then the employee may leak important details regarding the organisation.
    It also saves the organisation money since the employees are not allowed to download software; the organisation doesn’t
    have to pay for the licensing of the software that the employees might download if the policy wasn’t in place.
    Examples of Code of conduct policies that can be given out to the employees are:
    Use of email: The employees might not be allowed to say certain words or might be restricted to sending email to another
    user who is not part of the organisation. This policy is given to prevent employees from sending emails or from doing
    activities which are inappropriate and does not relate to their job such as: spamming, harassment, blackmail,
    information sharing and more.
    Internet usage policy: The organisation/employees might not be able to go on certain websites because of this. These
    websites can be social, adult sites and more. This policy is used by organisations to prevent the employees from getting
    distracted by going on websites which have nothing to do with their job. The network would be managed so they can see if
    any employees are trying to download something unnecessary or if they go on a website not related to their task. This
    policy is in place to also make sure that nothing can be downloaded that could potentially damage the system.
    Software acquisition: Used to restrict access to certain software. This can be because of legal issues and ones that
    might be dangerous to use.
    Installation policy: This policy does not allow employees to download external software that might need a licence or
    anything that might not be safe/legal to download. This way any threats affecting the system can be prevented since the
    company would have already downloaded anything needed themselves instead of the employees.
    User area usage policy: This is used in the organisation when there are a lot of employees using their systems. The
    policy defines a specific amount of storage space available to each user. The amount of storage they get depends on what
    type of job the user is doing, if they are completing tasks involving software then more storage space can be allocated
    to the user. Some organisations make certain files or information invalid for the storage space for copyright purposes.
    Account management policy: The user is responsible for maintaining a high level service whilst using the network. And it
    makes sure that the user does not release any details to anyone such as their password or other details which may affect
    the organisation.
    Budget Setting -
    Budget setting is a procedure in which an organisation sets a limit on the money they will spend on security for their
    systems. The budget is managed by the finance manager of the organisation and it is their responsibility and job to
    ensure that the security is updated and is within the budget limits. Budget setting is also a security measure that will
    set targets so that the company doesn’t go over budget when purchasing equipment or extra storage.
    This is mostly for when the company wants to upgrade equipment by purchasing new and better equipment. It can be time
    set for example every year or every 2+ years.
    The equipment can include:
    hardware that can improve performance for the computers or hardware which can improve security for more protected
    servers.
    software to improve security like buying password protection softwares to increase further security.
    Budget setting is really important for organisations in order to make sure that they have all the needed equipment and
    enough money put aside for things like:
    Replacing hardware,
    Training staff,
    Software listening costs,
    Staff wages,
    Security measure costs,
    External support for setting up systems or equipment.
    All of these have to be taken into account when the budget is being planned because all of these are essential and
    expensive, especially a good security system.
    Making sure there is enough money will also ensure that the organisation is less vulnerable from security attacks. (SO
    MAYBE WRITE: Budget setting will also ensure that the organisation is less vulnerable from security attacks.
    It might cost the organisation money, but it is really important to have security and keep client data safe and not
    spend extra money on fixing system hazards when they happen.
    
    Risk Management -
    This policy requires the organisation to make a plan on how to deal with each risk that they will face every day,
    depending on how high or low the risk might be.
    The organisation will look for possible issues that may affect the business ,and then make a plan for those issues so
    that their business is able to deal with the risk. They may also choose one of these risk management ideas or think of
    more depending on the risk level.
    They could tolerate the risk and do nothing, (a competitor trying to give you bad reputation)
    They could upgrade their system, (treat the issue such as looking for an upgrade which may stop the issue or reliable
    software which may stop the issue being a risk to the organisation.)
    They could deal with the risk by stopping it directly,(stopping a virus or hacker)
    Or they could transfer the risk by changing the way that they work.
    Each organisation has to implement a security measure because if it’s not implemented then any employee might be hurt or
    have their lives at risk. For example, not having a sign “wet floor” up, can cause an employee to slip and hurt
    themselves to the point of first aid attention.
    Risk management doesn’t just include injuries, it also includes financial problems for the organisation. All the
    information that is in risk management will have to be recorded on a document. This document should be stored in a safe
    place to avoid it being stolen or lost. For this, there will have to be procedures like a password and authorisation
    needed in order to access it.
    Surveillance and Monitoring Policies -
    This is a really important policy for the organisation to have because it will increase security drastically. Security
    and CCTV will allow the organisation to monitor what is happening inside and out in real time or it can be watched back.
    This way if anyone wants to steal or break in, they will be alert because of the
    and security measures. It will also help the organisation keep track of their equipment.
    This security feature will also allow the organisation to monitor the situation 24/7, like what the employees are doing
    and allows CCTV to be checked any time if needed when a serious matter arises. If a break in happens in the organisation
    CCTV will be available to monitor the situation and find out what happened and who was involved.
    Staff should be informed of surveillance taking place. Staff may feel like their privacy is being invaded by CCTV, so
    they should be informed of what it is used for.
    CCTV should be used with caution so it should be used to monitor security breaches, intruders in the areas where they
    don’t have access, and not to spy on staff.
    This can only be done if the employees agree to the organisations decision to use these techniques to keep their
    organisation safe. This could then lead the employees to use union action against the actions the organisation has
    taken.
    Employment Contract Security Affect
    Hiring policies -
    Date of Commencement (Page 1 and 2 of Full-time Lecturer contract)
    
    1.2 “No employment with a previous employer counts as part of your period of continuous employment with the Corporation.
    
    1.3 You may count any previous continuous local government service as part of your continuous employment with the
    Corporation for redundancy pay purposes, as provided under the Redundancy Payment.
    
    1.4 Your employment is for an indefinite period terminable on notice or otherwise as set out below.
    
    1.5 The first 10 months of your employment will be a probationary period, during which your suitability for the position
    to which you have been appointed will be assessed. During your probationary period, or at the end of it, your employment
    may be terminated either by you giving two month’s written notice or by the Corporation giving one month’s written
    notice. You will not be deemed to have passed your probationary period unless or until that is confirmed to you in
    writing.”
    
    “Requirement for Teaching Qualification (Page 4-5 of Full-time Lecturer contract)
    
    8.1 “The contract imposes on you a requirement to secure the qualifications of the type and within the timescale
    stipulated in your letter of appointment. The type of qualification required depends on a number of factors, including
    the date on which employment commenced and the type of post which is held.
    
    
    8.2 The College will review with you, either prior to commencement of employment or shortly thereafter, the
    qualifications required for the post that you are to fill, and will provide such assistance as it deems reasonable to
    enable you, if required, to secure requisite qualifications. In the event that you fail to secure requisite
    qualifications within the period specified in the Regulations, the College may have no alternative but to terminate your
    employment, and to this end the College reserves the right, notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, to
    terminate your employment by giving notice in writing in such circumstances.”
    
    How can employment contracts affect security -
    It is important to have separated duties within an organisation. This is because an organisation can’t rely on just one
    person to take care of all the tasks within an IT system. So when hiring someone the employment contract will state what
    certain task and job the employee will be assigned and expected to complete but if there was to be a certain task that
    could not be finished by an original employee that had to take care of it because of any type of absence then in that
    case they will have to cover for that individuals task until further notice.
    Duties are shared between a small number of people, if someone is off sick, there will still be people within the
    company who can be trusted to do complete it, otherwise, the job would either not get done (which could result in big
    costs) or someone who is not trusted to complete it might breach security.
    The contract also helps the employee to not be assigned to a task that they have no knowledge on which would cause them
    to be left to figure it out.
    
    Separation of duties -
    Duties (Page 2 of Full-time Lecturer contract)
    
    3.1 “You will be employed as a Lecturer in which capacity you will be required to perform such duties consistent with
    your position as may from time to time be assigned to you.
    
    3.2 Your duties are those as specified within your Job Description and will include, but will not be limited to
    formal... and cover for absent colleagues.
    
    3.4 You are expected to work flexibly and efficiently, to maintain the highest professional standards and to promote and
    implement the policies of the Corporation.
    
    3.5 You will be expected to comply with any rules and regulations, which the Corporation may from time to time issue to
    ensure the efficient operation of its business and the welfare and interests of its students and employees.
    
    3.7 There may be occasions when the College will need to contact you at home, for example, during a period of sickness
    or other type of absence or if there is an emergency at work of some sort. Therefore, you agree to provide your Line
    Manager with your address and telephone number.”
    
    
    The Working Week (Page 3 of Full-time Lecturer contract)
    
    a) “You will be expected to work such hours as are reasonably necessary for the proper performance of your duties and
    responsibilities. Normal working hours are 37 hours per week to be worked between Monday and Friday.
    
    b) You may, from time to time be requested in exceptional circumstances, to work on a Saturday and/or a Sunday in which
    case you will be given time off in lieu during your normal working week. “
    Place of Work (Page 4 of Full-time Lecturer contract)
    
    6.1 “Your principal place of work will initially be the Corporation’s premises at South Worcestershire College.However,
    you may be required to work on either a temporary or an indefinite basis at any premises which the Corporation currently
    has or may subsequently acquire or at any premises at which it may from time to time provide services.
    
    6.2 As part of your duties, you may be required to travel within the United Kingdom. Such travel may include attendance
    at conferences or seminars for the purposes of maintaining and updating your professional skills and the supervision of
    students on visits and work placements.”
    
    
    Continuing Professional Development (Page 5 of Full-time Lecturer contract)
    
    “You are required to:
    complete a minimum number of hours of continuing professional development (CPD) every year;
    maintain a record of the CPD you have undertaken;
    make that record available to the College
    Full details of the College’s policy in relation to Continuing Professional Development will be communicated to you.”
    
    Exclusivity of Service (Page 8 of Full-time Lecturer contract)
    
    “You are required to devote your full time, attention and abilities to your duties during your working hours and to act
    in the best interests of the Corporation at all times.
    
    It follows that, regardless of whether you are employed on a full-time or a part-time contract, you are required to
    notify the Principal of any employment or engagement which you intend to undertake whilst in the employment of the
    College (including any such employment or engagement which commenced before your employment under this contract). The
    Principal will then notify you ordinarily within 10 working days whether such employment or engagement is prohibited.
    
    Equipment and other property belonging to the Corporation shall be used only with the approval of the Principal and only
    for the purposes of teaching, approved research, or approved consultancy.”
    
    How can employment contracts affect security -
    When someone is being hired, their hiring record is checked, which would look back at their previous jobs,if they have
    any criminal records and just the general background of the person they are thinking to employ. References also count
    under this category. Even after the background check there’s another way to ensure security by having a probationary
    period. This allows the employee to gain trust and for the organisation to be safe. If in that period the employee does
    something wrong such as commit theft this gives the employer the right to sack the employee without discipline or
    warnings since they are still within a probationary period.
    
    Disciplinary procedures -
    Disciplinary Procedure (Page 12 of Full-time Lecturer contract)
    
    “The Corporation expects reasonable standards of performance and conduct from its employees. Details of its Disciplinary
    Rules and Procedures are available on the College Portal. The Procedure is non-contractual and may be varied by the
    Corporation from time to time.
    
    You may from time to time be required to participate in some capacity in the management of a disciplinary procedure
    relating to an employee whether involving your subordinates or not.“
    
    How can employment contracts affect security -
    Every organisation has this procedure so that employees can be dealt with fairly and confidentially if something were to
    happen. The disciplinary actions will depend on the problem which has occurred. Mostly this will have to do with
    employees doing something that is punishable by law, such as stealing from the company. A small incident may only
    require a meeting with the supervisor to discuss the event that happened which may also be recorded for future
    reference. Or something bigger may require the employees suspension with pay while an investigation will take place to
    ensure that the employee is either guilty or innocent on the accusations they have been given. This is all done to make
    sure that an employee is rightfully fired for a good reason and not just accusations, there could be legal consequences
    with great costs to the company otherwise.
    There will also be situations called infringement which means that someone innocent is blamed by an individual. There’s
    certain ways this is dealt with such as suspension of the individual that was blamed (but they will still be paid) and
    an outside company would have to come in to investigate the incident so the situation is dealt with fairly. Sometimes
    the police will have to be called depending on the security issue which has occurred or if the company feels that it is
    a criminal offence.
    Training and communication of responsibilities -
    
    Appraisal and Development (Page 3 of Full-time Lecturer contract)
    
    “You will be required to:
    participate in reasonable arrangements for your further training and development.”
    
    Teaching Hours and Responsibilities (Page 3 of Full-time Lecturer contract)
    
    “5.3.1 In determining such responsibilities the following factors will be taken into account:
    
    a) the full range and extent of the actual duties to be performed;
    b) career development needs;
    c) teaching experience and course experience;
    e) differing course and subject needs;
    g) the desirability of achieving a reasonable balance of activities;
    
    
    5.3.2 Your normal scheduled teaching duties will be 864 hours each year. During the year you may also be required to
    undertake up to 36 hours
    5.3.3 You may be required to teach for absent colleagues and this would be included within your annual teaching
    workload.”
    
    How can employment contracts affect security -
    
    Training and communication is a must. If a new employee starts working they must be shown how to use new and certain
    equipment they might not know about. The company must be certain that they have received the right training to use
    equipment correctly and manage everything within the organisation that they have been set to do. If this is not done
    equipment can get damaged ,used in the wrong way or tasks not completed the way they were expected to be done.
    Communication is really important to be practiced in the workplace so the employees feel that they can communicate when
    needed, such when questions are needed to be answered ,if a fire starts or there is a problem with the system.
    The company needs to make sure that the employees know their responsibilities. Responsibilities are really crucial to
    the company. Because if someone wasn't sure what they were supposed to do on a task it could impact the company since it
    can cause a lot of confusion,possible system breaches, health and safety aspects.
    
    
    The Role Of Ethical Decision Making In Organisational IT Security
    
    What is the professional body and what do they do? -
    
    A Professional Body is an organisation full of individual members that practice a profession/occupation in which the
    organisation has the knowledge, skills ,conduct and practice of that particular profession/occupation.
    
    For example a science professional body would have members practicing science.
    
    How an organisations association with professional bodies can impact their professional and ethical decision making -
    Professional bodies have a major role in social mobility. Professional bodies maintain and improve practical,ethical and
    behaviour standards. They act to encourage fair access for social , gender or race discriminations and discourage
    discrimination itself.
    The bodies offer career advice to their members. From resumes or cover letters to job searching tips and negotiating
    techniques.
    And ethical decision making will -
    Generate and sustain trust,
    Demonstrate respect and responsibility,
    Fairness and caring.
    They are also consistent with great citizenship. These provide better decisions by setting rules for behaviour.
    So for an organisation to associate with professional bodies is a big impact for great ethical decision making.
    Some of Professional body organisations for IT security:
    Business Software Alliance (BSA),
    Federation Against Software Theft (FAST),
    British Computing Society (BCS),
    Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).
    
    Role of ethical decision making in organisational IT security -
    Ethical decision making is a tough role for individuals within organisations. It is difficult because each person has
    their own views, ethics and business decision making. And most people clash because of those differences. Ethics is
    someone's values and qualities that they view. So there’s lots of arguments and opinions within an organisation.
    Ethical decision making:
    
    Freedom of information versus personal privacy -
    Positives - The internet is always advancing and the freedom to present information about oneself or opinions is huge
    these days. Such as various websites, social media and job sites. It’s a great advance in technology because individuals
    are able to apply for jobs online, check bank accounts without leaving home or even check how their friends are doing
    through the help of social media.
    Negatives - However the downfall of this is the individual's personal privacy. If they were to do anything mentioned
    above such as applying for a job or logging into their bank account.
    They would be placing their trust in the computer system to keep their personal information (bank details, address and
    more) confidential and only accessible to them.
    For example if there was a malicious user searching for certain personal information about an individual, the
    information would be available on social media or by using internet tools that could find needed information just from a
    name. Tools like these can be really dangerous in the hands of skilled individuals.
    Freedom vs Personal Privacy - This can happen during business affairs. Installing CCTV within the organisation for
    security reasons. But some employees might feel that their privacy is being invaded. This can cause tension in the
    workplace which would cause someone to make an ethical decision that would benefit the organisation and also keep the
    staff happy.
    Or another ethical argument happens with employees being monitored. Technology these days can monitor a lot, such as
    websites, communications and programs that are being visited by the employee. Some employees feel disappointed that
    their employer doesn’t trust them to do what they are required to do at work. They also feel that it's a gross invasion
    of their privacy.
    Permission -
    Tension is also caused when it comes to photography usage,videos and CCTV footage for business purposes.
    For example if an organisation were to make a marketing video that included a bit of audio from celebrities, images of
    employees and this were to be presented to another large organisation without permission from the celebrity or the
    employees this would not only cause ethical issues but also legal actions. Many organisations struggle with ethical
    decisions as it is hard to please everyone with their individual views. Organisations must decide what they will allow
    and reject in terms of ethical values so they have some form of ethical decisions the organisations will view upon.
    
    How will making ethical decisions rather than relying on legislations alone impact the :
    
    Employees -
    The impact of having not just legislations but also ethical decisions among staff can make people clash because of
    different opinions but it can also help build a stronger team and increase productivity. Which will also create a
    happier workplace.
    Loyalty -
    Loyal employees will remain with the company longer, loyal employees are good ambassadors for the company outside of
    work because they demonstrate pride for the company. Loyalty also relies on employees to keep confidential information
    secret. Especially relying on ethical behaviour and smart choices such as to lock computers, to not share passwords.
    Honest with money -
    Cash registers are still used and trusting an employee with money just to find out that they are stealing from the
    company is a huge impact. There will be much more trust with ethical employees behind a register because they would even
    put back a penny in the register if they found it on the floor.
    Owning up to mistakes -
    Making mistakes can cost a person their job. So most people will naturally avoid responsibility when they make mistakes
    at work. But ethical workers understand the importance in solving problems. It might not be easy but they know that
    owning up to a mistake is the fastest way to resolve a situation and learn from it. And this is a trait employers look
    for.
    Customers -
    Ethics with customers presents companies in a good light and customers will trust the company. Ethics in customer
    dealings improves the quality of service and develops positive relationships.
    People within the company look upon their leaders and conduct their behavior accordingly. Companies whose leaders are
    not ethical are more likely to be leading a company of people who like to be unethical in all their dealings.
    For a business to be successful and to exist, it needs customers. Customers have are smart, well-informed and quick to
    recognize if they are being cheated. The company’s success is built on trust and confidence with the customer which
    happens only if they practice ethics in customer dealings. Ethics in customer dealings is doing the right thing and not
    doing it just because there are legal repercussions otherwise.
    Legislations are laws that help regulate society and impact decision making. While ethical decision making comes from a
    person's moral sense and a desire to maintain self respect.
